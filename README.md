Create a new project and open the existing .h and .cpp file in it. then navigate to project directory and place data.txt in it
after that run the code and it will show you content of array and one after an other it will ask you to give specific inputs to
test the entire logic and function asked to write, other than that we have also handles some exceptions through try catch statement
so like if at any point the index of array gets out of bound it will show a specific method rather than crashing

for Employee.cpp simply open that file in your IDE and run it, it will run the main function and show data of the employees created
